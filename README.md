# ProjectStamp
Script for Adobe Illustrator. <br>
Adds a frame of project metadata entered into the form.

<br>
The script uses the file "Assets/Template.svg" as a template for positioning the entered information. <br>
The placement of elements inside the frame can be changed. <br>
Do not change the text of text elements, because the script searches for objects by their content. <br>

<br>
Permanent information can be specified in "Assets/DesignerProfile.txt".  <br>
It will be automatically added to the form field. <br>

 <br>
The list of available colors is compiled from the "Spot Color" project.
