# ProjectStamp
Script for Adobe Illustrator. <br>
Adds a frame of project metadata entered into the form.

<br>
The script uses the file "Assets/Template.svg" as a template. <br>
The placement of elements inside the frame can be changed (do not change the text of the text elements).

<br><br>
Permanent information can be specified in "Assets/DesignerProfile.txt".  <br>
It will be automatically added to the form field.
